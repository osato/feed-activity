# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` 

To get the node package for installed modules

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\


## More Information

If on starting the application, you see JSX linter error from App.tsx file, please modify line 21 in tsconfig.json to - "jsx": "react" (Bootstrapped with Typescript)

For this app, I have included material-ui core and icons for better UI design.
